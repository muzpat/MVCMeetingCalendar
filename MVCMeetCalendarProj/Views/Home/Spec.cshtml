    <b>Program Spec:</b>
<p>
    Your employer has an existing system for employees to submit booking requests for meetings in the boardroom. Your employer has now asked you to to implement a system for processing batches of booking requests.
    Your processing system must process input as text. The first line of the input text represents the company office hours, in 24 hour clock format, and the remainder of the input represents individual booking requests. Each booking request is in the following format.
    <br />
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            [request submission time, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [ARCH:employee id]
        </tr>
        <tr>[meeting start time, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [ARCH:meeting duration in hours] </tr>
    </table>
    A sample text input follows, to be used in your solution.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>0900 1730  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2011-03-17 10:17:06 EMP001 </td>

    <b>Constraints: </b>
    <br />
    •	No part of a meeting may fall outside office hours.
    <br />
    •	Meetings may not overlap.  
    <br />
    •	The booking submission system only allows one submission at a time, so submission times are guaranteed to be unique.  
    <br />
    •	Bookings must be processed in the chronological order in which they were submitted.  
    <br />
    •	The ordering of booking submissions in the supplied input is not guaranteed.  
    <br />
    <b>Notes </b>
    <br />
    •	The current requirements make no provision for alerting users of failed bookings; it is up to the user to confirm that their booking was successful. 
    <br />
    •	Although the system that you produce may open and parse a text file for input, this is not part of the requirements. As long as the input text is in the correct format, the method of input is up to the developer.
